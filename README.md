# CardMasterShop-Project
Final project for CoderHouse Javascript course.
Done 100& with JS vanill and sass. 
I learned a lot from this project, mostly manipulating the DOM with JavaScript and doing Asynchronous code.
Works with Local Storage to persist data and API's to get the products catalogue from a CMS.
