# CardMasterShop-Project
This is an ecommerce I've done with JS vanilla and sass/css. </br>
I learned a lot from this project, mostly manipulating the DOM with JS, organizing techniques for bigger projects and working with Asynchronous 
requests .</br>
Works with Local Storage to persist data and API's to get the products catalogue from a CMS. </br>
